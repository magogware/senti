# Senti
Senti is a game exploring the dialogue between noise (sound effects) and immersion in virtual reality. It's a work-in-progress aiming for a Februrary 2022 demo release. Beyond that, Senti may see development into a full game, or it may remain a VR experiment.

## Can I try it out?
I'd actually prefer you didn't yet! Aside from being very, very unfinished, Senti is part of a research project I'm conducting on noise and immersion in VR, and I need to interview people who play through it as part of that research. If you're interested in playing, contact me (ciao at barilaro dot me) and I can set up a date and time for a playthrough and interview when the game is ready to be released.
